# AWS Concepts

This repository covers fundamental concepts of **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, a leading cloud computing platform offering scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions.

## Key AWS Concepts

### 1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)  
EC2 provides resizable virtual servers in the cloud, allowing users to run applications with flexible computing capacity. It supports various instance types and auto-scaling.

### 2. S3 (Simple Storage Service)  
S3 is an object storage service that offers high durability, scalability, and security. It is used for storing and retrieving large amounts of data, backups, and static website hosting.

### 3. RDS (Relational Database Service)  
RDS is a managed database service that supports multiple database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It simplifies database administration with automated backups and scaling.

### 4. Lambda  
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and charges only for execution time.

### 5. IAM (Identity and Access Management)  
IAM enables secure access control to AWS resources by managing users, roles, and permissions. It supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) and fine-grained access policies.

### 6. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)  
VPC allows users to create isolated cloud networks with complete control over IP addressing, routing, and security. It enables secure communication between AWS resources.

### 7. CloudFront  
CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the distribution of web content globally. It reduces latency and enhances security with DDoS protection.

### 8. SNS (Simple Notification Service)  
SNS is a fully managed messaging service that enables push notifications, SMS, and email alerts. It is commonly used for event-driven applications and system alerts.

### 9. SQS (Simple Queue Service)  
SQS is a message queuing service that enables decoupling of distributed applications. It ensures reliable message delivery between components.

### 10. Auto Scaling  
Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. It helps maintain performance while optimizing costs.
